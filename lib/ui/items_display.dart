// TO DO Laboratory #02
/// The first step before creating the class is to establish if this screen is Stateless or Stateful.
/// Think some steps ahead. You know that the shop articles have a number that represent their stock.
/// So when a user buys the article or you replenish the stock, the number changes and the UI
/// has to update to reflect the current values.
///
/// Widgets to use:
/// - Scaffold
/// - AppBar
///     * Title (name of your shop)
/// - ListView.builder
///     * ItemCount
///     * Builder
/// - Card
/// - ListTile
///     * Title
///     * Subtitle
/// - Padding
///     * Padding
/// - Center
///
/// Observations:
/// - For the moment, nothing should happen when pressing an item
/// - For the moment, lets not think on linking other screens with other purposes - they will come in time. Lets focus
/// on what we know at this point
///
/// After you have finished implementing this screen, remember to link it to the 'home' property that you can find in the
/// main.dart file. So when you boot up your app, this will be the first screen to show up
///
/// REMINDER: DO NOT DELETE THESE INSTRUCTIONS
